# Participant Id

_Create secure, anonymous, and stable Participant Ids._

This app aims to support psychological research and protect study participants' privacy by generating secure, anonymous, and stable Participant Ids.

Please let me know if you use _Participant Id_ in your study. I would love to link it on the [App's homepage](https://moodpatterns.info/participantId/index.html)

## Contribution

### Language support
Any additional languages are more than welcome.

If you are tech-savvy, please just make a pull request.

If not, please create a JSON file analogous to those you can find [here](https://github.com/MoodPatterns/participant_id/tree/master/assets/translations).

### Non-breaking changes
Contributions are welcome to make the app more transparent, easier to understand, easier on the eye, more lightweight, or add support for more platforms. Please just raise an issue before the PR.

### Breaking changes
I will not accept PRs that break the current behavior (different questions or other hashing of the responses).
If you need just changes anyway, please just fork the repo. If you are not tech-savvy and need such changes, please contact me, and I will see what I can do for you.
